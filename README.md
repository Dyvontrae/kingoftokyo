# This is King of Tokyo!

This is my journey in learning Rust. I took the first implementations of the lessons I've learned from YouTube and the Rust Tutorials on the **"Rust By Example"** on their website (https://www.rust-lang.org/). You are able to launch and play this game in browser via the play.rust-lang.org compiler. 


# Files

So far it's only the .rs file in which you can complie locally via Cargo or run in browser on the Rust Compiler (https://play.rust-lang.org/). Please help support with suggestions, comments and more efficient methods to utilize in learning how to implement better game logic.
